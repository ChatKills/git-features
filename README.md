GitHub features I learned
    - Can create remote repositories that can be connected from VSCode that helps by having a separate and stable branch that can  be used as a backup if the code your working on becomes corrupted or unavailable.
    - Can be used to store the master code while other members of the team work on their own versions without getting in the way of each other.
    - Can be used to present projects to potential clients and employers.
